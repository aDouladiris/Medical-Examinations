# Medical-Examinations

MVC and Observer patterns for an app that you can choose to take medical examinations and records them written in Php.

TODO:
- Incude all queries in Dao model.
- Observer pattern needs abstract class.
- Credentials from SESSION and not hardcoded for test purposes.
- Remove border lines for design purposes.
- As a one week project (from the uploaded day), needs a lot of clean up for duplicate folders/files.
